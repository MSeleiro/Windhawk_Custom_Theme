## Windhawk Custom Theme - By Miguel Seleiro

### Description

It's literally a merge of the [Down Aero](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windows-11-start-menu-styling-guide/blob/main/Themes/Down%20Aero/README.md) theme and the [TranslucentStartMenu](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windows-11-start-menu-styling-guide/blob/main/Themes/TranslucentStartMenu/README.md) theme, with a slight height tweak to accomodate pinned folders.
The search menu has the same height as the start menu.
